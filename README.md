# EventTrackerProject

## Description
	This application allows a user to track information related to a job application. Including company details, contact information, interview questions, and offer details. 

## Technologies Used
	Spring Tool Suite, Spring Data JPA/REST, MySQL Workbench, Gradle, Java.

## Lessons Learned

	This project was my first using Spring REST and the JPA Repository Interface.
Along with that came the implementation of JSON and testing through Postman.
I continued learning about CRUD operations and the relationship between parent/child dependencies. Most of my trouble shooting involved Delete operations when child dependencies existed. 
I really enjoy the building of more complicated  controller operations and ServiceImpl methods.
